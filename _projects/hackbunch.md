# Hackbunch
Hackbunch is basically a web project I am working on that calculattes the total amount of PR's, additions and deletions made by a group of people,and acclrding makes a collage of the group members and displays it. It is written in Python3 and using Flask framework.

This is an on going project and I am working on it constantly trying to improve it :)
