This algorithm chooses the nearest neighbour of the data point to be of the same class. This algorithm also uses a majority voting mechanim, in which the algorithm (n-KKN model) uses the 'n'th neighbours to determine the class of the data points.

# Alogrithm
1. Pick a value for 'k'
2. Calculate the distance for the unknown cases
3. Selecr the k-observations in the training data that is nearest to the unknown data points
4. Predict the class using the most popular response from the k-neighbours (for regression average of the popular responses is taken)
